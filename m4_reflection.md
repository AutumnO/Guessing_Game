Milestone 4 - Guessing Game - CS 211
Autumn Ossello

The most difficult thing about Milestone 4 was figuring out how to turn a text file into a binary tree. Although more hours went into other parts of the project, this took the most time to work through. I tried to brute force it and ultimately realized I needed to go back up the tree which made me think recursive, but I couldn’t figure out how to call the function recursively with the addition of StreamReader. I tried a bunch of different approaches until I accidently wrote an endless loop that froze Unity and couldn’t figure out where it was happening. I suppose that’s what I get for coding at 4am… 

Because I couldn’t test anything until I fixed the looping, I decided to spend my energy creating the other aspects of the project, so I wouldn’t have as much to do once I figured out the tree. During my lab with Adam the loop was fixed, initiating a good eight hours of epiphanies. My understanding of Unity has skyrocketed within a day and the rest of the project fell smoothly into place. I ran into issues but none that I couldn’t quickly figure out, and the lack of problems with Unity freed me up to solely think about the code. While in previous projects the software has been the source of all my problems, this time it felt like Unity made my job easier and more clear. Things that I had been struggling with, such as connecting code to the buttons and creating a tree that I could use everywhere, became significantly simpler when I figured out how to put them together in Unity. I think this was a great project for that purpose, the simplicity of it in particular. It was much easier to understand how Unity works for me when the majority of my work was within the scripts. With the card game I found myself frequently overwhelmed by the multitude of technicalities I had to think about, and I wasn’t sure where to start or even how to accomplish those simple tasks so that they worked in tandem. 

This project ended up being really fun to work on, it boosted my confidence and understanding of the material. Even when I realized I had gone on an unnecessary coding tangent and had to delete a bunch of stuff it was still exciting and motivating. I found it helpful particularly to diagram different cases and how they translated to the text document when figuring out where to insert the new questions and answers. I believe the most important thing I discovered working on this project was how useful the class variables were. They allowed me to combine classes so I wasn’t constantly struggling with how to access the tree data, and track parents so I could move both ways through the tree.

In addition to all this, near the end of the project my computer’s fan malfunctioned and stopped working all together, meaning its usefulness only lasted until it heated up and caused the CPU to be heavily stressed. At the point of writing this my milestone project is almost finished, the input is still not working as expected, which I pinpointed to the wait for keycode function being considered complete on its second call, although I haven’t figured out why and I need to let my laptop cool off because it’s getting hard to type. I tested the rewriting of the file with string variables and it works fine, as I can see everything is ready to go except the input which I will work on tomorrow. Whether or not I manage to get it done I will add the gif to the project then.
